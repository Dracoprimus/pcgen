# Vow of Poverty Abilities
AC Bonus				KEY:AC Bonus ~ Vow of Poverty				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A 1st-level ascetic receives a +4 exalted bonus to his Armor Class. The bonus increases to +5 at 3rd level, and thereafter increases by +1 for each 3 character levels. This bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons, however, do not ignore this bonus. This does not stack with an armor bonus.

Bonus Exalted Feats		KEY:Bonus Exalted Feats ~ Vow of Poverty		SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:At 1st level, an ascetic gets a bonus exalted feat, and another bonus feat at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Unlike the other benefits of a vow of poverty, a character does not gain these bonus feats retroactively when he takes the Vow of Poverty feat; he only gains those bonus feats that apply for the levels he gains after swearing his vow. Thus, the bonus feat gained at 1st level is available only to humans who take both Sacred Vow and Vow of Poverty at 1st level.
Endure Elements			KEY:Endure Elements ~ Vow of Poverty		SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A 3rd-level ascetic is immune to the effects of being in a hot or cold environment. He can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves (as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Exalted Strike			KEY:Exalted Strike ~ Vow of Poverty			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, an ascetic gains a +1 enhancement bonus on all his attack and damage rolls. In effect, any weapon the character wields becomes a +1 magic weapon, and can overcome the damage reduction of a creature as though it were a magic weapon. This enhancement bonus rises to +2 at 10th level, to +3 at 14th level, to +4 at 17th level, and to +5 at 20th level. At 10th level, any weapon damage the character deals is also considered to be good-aligned, so that it can bypass the damage reduction of some evil outsiders.

# Class Abilities

###Block: Anointed Knight
50
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An anointed knight is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor, and shields.
Anoint Self (Su): An anointed knight concocts a magic oil with which to anoint herself, at a cost of 100 gp (for alchemical components). She can make only one dose of the oil each time this class feature is gained (at 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th level). Creating the oil takes 1 hour. Applying the oil is a ceremony that takes 8 hours. Once the oil is applied, the anointed knight permanently gains a new supernatural ability chosen from the accompanying list. Her level plus Charisma modifier determines the choices available to her (the highest-numbered choice possible, or any lower one). An anointed knight cannot choose an ability more than once, nor can she replace one ability with another once the choice is made.
51
# Anoint Self
2 or lower Holy Sight: The knight gains the Alertness feat.
3-4 Celestial Strategy: The knight gains the Combat Reflexes feat.
5-6 Unbroken Flesh: The knight gains damage reduction 3/-.
7-8 Divine Clarity: The knight's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score improves by 1.
9 Call to Battle: Three times per day, the knight gains an extra +3 bonus on her attack roll when charging.
10 Deep Strike: Three times per day, on a successful attack, the knight deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.
11+ Inspired Strike: Three times per day, the knight can take a single extra attack at her highest attack bonus as a free action.
#
Anoint Ancestral Weapon (Su): An anointed knight concocts a magic oil with which to coat her ancestral weapon, at a cost of 100 gp (for alchemical components). She can make only one dose of the oil each time this class feature is gained (at 2nd, 5th, and 8th level). If the oil is applied to a weapon other than the anointed knight's ancestral weapon, nothing happens and the oil is wasted. Creating the oil takes 1 hour. Applying the oil is a ceremony that takes 8 hours. Once the oil is applied, the ancestral weapon permanently gains a new supernatural ability chosen from the accompanying list. The knight's level plus Charisma modifier determines the choices available to her (the highest-numbered choice possible, or any lower one). An anointed knight cannot choose an ability more than once, nor can she replace one ability with another once the choice is made.
# Anoint Ancestral Weapon
3 or lower Good Weapon: The ancestral weapon deals 1d6 points of damage per round to any evil creature that holds or wields it. The weapon also becomes a good-aligned weapon.
4-6 Sunder Resistance: The ancestral weapon gains 10 points of hardness.
7-8 Unicorn's Blood: Any evil creature wounded by the weapon must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or suffer the weakening effects of unicorn blood.1
9 Impervious: The ancestral weapon gains an extra 50 hp.
10+ Sentience: The ancestral weapon becomes an intelligent item, with the same alignment as the knight.
#
Bonus Feat: At 3rd level, and again at 6th and 9th level, the anointed knight gains a bonus feat. This feat must be drawn from the following feats, and the knight must meet all the prerequisites for it: Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Dodge, Endurance, Exalted Smite*, Great Cleave, Holy Subdual*, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Overrun, Improved Sunder, Improved Trip, Mobility, Power Attack, Sanctify Martial Strike*, Sanctify Weapon*, Spring Attack, Subduing Strike*, Whirlwind Attack.

52
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Apostles of peace gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. As part of their sacred vows, apostles of peace forswear the use of armor, though they may wear magic items that protect them (such as a ring of protection or bracers of armor). An apostle of peace who wears any armor is unable to cast apostle of peace spells or use any of his supernatural class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
Spells: An apostle of peace has the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast an apostle of peace spell, the apostle must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an apostle with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Apostle of peace bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the apostle of peace's Wisdom modifier. When the apostle of peace gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 2nd-level spells for a 2nd-level apostle), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The apostle of peace's spell list appears below. An apostle of peace prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does. To determine the caster level of an apostle of peace, add the character's apostle levels to one-half of his caster levels in other spellcasting classes.
Spontaneous Casting: An apostle of peace can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the apostle did not prepare ahead of time. An apostle can "lose" any prepared apostle spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).
Turn Undead (Su): An apostle of peace can turn undead as a good cleric of his apostle of peace level would. If he is also a cleric (or paladin), he adds his apostle levels to his effective cleric levels to determine his turning capability.
Pacifying Touch (Su): At 2nd level, an apostle of peace gains the ability to pacify hostile or angry creatures by touch. The effect is similar to the calm emotions spell. The apostle can affect only a single target with each use of the ability, and must touch the target. A touched creature receives no saving throw and spell resistance does not apply. The pacifying touch does not suppress positive emotions, just anger, rage, and hostility. The apostle of peace can make a level check as if casting dispel magic, using his character level as his caster level, to dispel certain mind-affecting spells affecting the target. The pacifying touch can only dispel spells that incite violent emotions in the target, such as fear or rage.
Censure Fiends (Su): A 4rd-level apostle of peace can censure fiends, much as good clerics turn undead. Channeling holy power from the celestial planes, he can make demons, devils, and other outsiders with the evil subtype recoil. Make a Charisma check for the apostle and consult Table 8-9 in the Player's Handbook, using the apostle's character level to determine the most powerful fiend he can censure. Roll 2d6 + the apostle of peace's level + his Charisma modifier for censuring damage. Using both the apostle's character level and his class level in this manner means that he is more likely to affect a single powerful fiend, but unlikely to censure more than one of them. A censured fiend is stunned by the apostle's holy power for 1d4+1 rounds. If an apostle of peace attacks a censured fiend, the stunning ends immediately and the fiend can act normally on its next turn. If the apostle of peace's character level is at least twice the fiend's Hit Dice, he banishes the affected fiend back to its home plane. An apostle of peace can make a number of censuring attempts per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. These attempts are separate from any attempts to turn undead.

###Block: Beloved of Valarian
54

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A beloved of Valarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and small shields.
Spells: A beloved of Valarian has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a beloved of Valarian spell, the beloved must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a beloved of Valarian with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Beloved of Valarian bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the beloved's Wisdom modifier. When the beloved of Valarian gets 0 spells of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st level beloved of Valarian), she gets only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. The beloved of Valarian's spell list appears below. A beloved of Valarian prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a beloved cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).
Call Unicorn (Su): A beloved of Valarian can call a unicorn to her side. See the Monster Manual for the unicorn's statistics. The unicorn appears instantly and serves the character for life, provided she remains chaste and of good alignment. The unicorn may be dismissed at any time, although a character cannot call another until she gains a level in the beloved of Valarian class. If the unicorn should die before its rider, the character may call another unicorn companion when she gains a new level in this class. A beloved of Valarian can have no more than one unicorn companion at any given time. A beloved of Valarian can assign her unicorn companion to undertake different types of tasks. Particularly useful as a mount, the unicorn typically will not undergo a quest or otherwise take on complex burdens without the supervision of the beloved of Valarian.
Telepathic Bond (Su): A beloved of Valarian can communicate telepathically with her unicorn companion. This bond remains in effect unless the character is separated from her unicorn by a number of miles equal to 100 + the beloved's character level. At 6th level, a Valarian's beloved can communicate telepathically with any animal native to her unicorn companion's home forest.
Timelessness (Su): Unicorns age very slowly, living for thousands of years. As long as she remains faithful to Valarian and has a unicorn companion serving her, a beloved of Valarian ages just as slowly, the aging process essentially halted.
Ethereal Jaunt (Sp): At 2nd level, once per day, a beloved of Valarian and her equipment may become ethereal, as the ethereal jaunt spell cast by a sorcerer of the beloved's character level. If the beloved of Valarian is astride her unicorn companion, it is also affected by this ability. However, if the beloved of Valarian dismounts or the two otherwise become separated before the ethereal jaunt expires, the unicorn companion instantly returns to the Material Plane.
Forest Dweller (Ex):Time spent in the forest alters a beloved of Valarian's physiology at 3rd level. She gains a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks.
Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a beloved of Valarian can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when caught flat-footed. If the beloved of Valarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class (rogue, for example), she gains improved uncanny dodge instead; she cannot be flanked except by a rogue who has at least four more rogue levels than she has in this prestige class. As long as the beloved of Valarian is riding her unicorn companion, it gains the benefit of this ability as well.
Call Celestial Charger (Su): At 6th level, a beloved of Valarian can call a celestial unicorn-also known as a celestial charger- to her side. See the Unicorn entry in the Monster Manual for the celestial charger's statistics. If the beloved of Valarian already has a unicorn companion, Valarian transforms it into a celestial charger instead of sending his beloved a new companion.
Nature's Understanding (Ex): At 7th level, a beloved of Valarian gains a +2 insight bonus on Handle Animal, Knowledge (nature), and Survival checks.
Holy Smite (Sp): Starting at 8th level, once per day, a beloved of Valarian can cast holy smite as a cleric of her class level. She may choose to deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage with the holy smite.
Wood Repulsion (Su): Weapons partially or wholly fashioned from wood have a harder time striking a beloved of Valarian, as though deflected by some invisible barrier. Attacks made with such weapons take a -2 penalty. As long as the beloved of Valarian is riding her unicorn companion, it gains the benefit of this ability as well.
Mass Baleful Polymorph (Sp): At 10th level, once per day, a beloved of Valarian can cast a special version of the baleful polymorph spell that affects all evil creatures within 30 feet of her (as a 10th-level druid). Affected creatures are transformed into harmless Diminutive mammals (rabbits, squirrels, or the like) or Fine vermin (nonthreatening spiders, centipedes, or the like). All affected creatures are transformed into the same type of creature. See the baleful polymorph spell description in the Player's Handbook for details.

# 55
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Celestial mystics gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Blessing of the Silver Heaven (Su): A 1st-level celestial mystic gains electricity resistance 10 and a +2 sacred bonus on

# 56
saving throws against disease, poison, and petrification. In addition,
a magic circle against evil effect always surrounds the mystic,
identical with the spell cast by a cleric whose level equals the
celestial mystic's character level.
Spells per Day/Spells Known: At 2nd level, and each level
thereafter, a celestial mystic gains new spells per day (and
spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a
spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige
class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character
of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning
or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so
on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a
character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming
a celestial mystic, he must decide to which class he adds
the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.
Celestial Spells: Once he reaches 2nd level, a celestial
mystic can cast spells as if he were an archon. Specifically,
the mystic can cast any spell described in Chapter 6 that has
a celestial or archon component, as long as he can otherwise
cast the spell (it appears on his spell list, it is of a level of
spells that he can cast, and he has a sufficient ability score to
cast spells of that level). He does not gain any other celestial
qualities. For instance, he is not immune to the blast of a
trumpet archon.
Blessing of the Golden Heaven (Su): A celestial mystic of
3rd level or higher is immune to death spells and magical death
effects.
Blessing of the Pearly Heaven (Su): A 5th-level celestial
mystic retains his Dexterity bonus to AC regardless of being
caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. In addition,
a celestial mystic may make a mystical knowledge check with a
bonus equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier to see
whether he knows some relevant information about legendary
people, places, or items. If he has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge
(history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check. Otherwise this
works as a bardic knowledge check.
Blessing of the Crystal Heaven (Su): At 7th level, a celestial
mystic can cure his own wounds. He can cure up to three times
his class level in hit points each day, and he can spread this healing
out among several uses. In addition, he gains immunity to
disease and poison, and a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws
against Enchantment spells and effects.
Blessing of the Platinum Heaven (Su): At 8th level, a celestial
mystic gains the ability to channel spell energy into a bolt of
holy power. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range
(400 ft. + 40 ft./class level) and deals 4d6 points of damage plus
1d6 points of damage per level of the spell channeled to create
the effect. For example, a celestial mystic who channels a 7thlevel
spell into holy power deals 11d6 points of damage to the
target if the bolt hits.
Blessing of the Glittering Heaven (Su): At 9th level, a
celestial mystic gains spell resistance 20 and damage reduction
10/unholy.
Blessing of the Illuminated Heaven (Su): A 10th-level
celestial mystic is surrounded by an aura of positive energy to a
radius of 10 feet. Within that emanation, life flourishes: colors
are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations
are more intense. (This effect is purely sensory; game effects
such as energy damage are not affected.) All living creatures
within the aura, including the celestial mystic, gain fast healing
2 as an extraordinary ability as long as they remain there. No
undead creature with fewer than 10 HD can enter the aura, and
those brought into it act as if they had been turned. Undead
with 10 HD or more can enter the aura unharmed, but they do
not gain fast healing.


###Block: 
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Champions of Gwynharwyf
gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells: A champion of Gwynharwyf has the ability to cast a
small number of divine spells. To cast a champion of Gwynharwyf
spell, the champion must have a Wisdom score of at least 10

# 57
+ the spell's level, so a champion of Gwynharwyf
with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these
spells. Champion of Gwynharwyf bonus spells
are based on Wisdom, and saving throws
against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell
level + the champion's Wisdom modifier.
When the champion gets 0 spells of a
given spell level (for instance, 1st-level
spells for a 1st level champion of
Gwynharwyf), she gets only the
bonus spells she would be
entitled to based on her
Wisdom score for that
spell level.
The champion of
Gwynharwyf's spell
list appears below. A
champion of Gwynharwyf
prepares and casts spells just
as a cleric does (though a
champion cannot spontaneously
cast cure spells).
Detect Evil (Sp): At will, a
champion of Gwynharwyf can use
detect evil, as the spell. She can use this
ability even while raging.
Rage (Ex): A champion of Gwynharwyf adds her
class levels to her barbarian levels to determine
how often she can rage and when she gains the
greater rage, tireless rage, and mighty rage barbarian
class abilities. She does not gain or
improve any other barbarian class abilities.
Smite Evil (Su):
Once per day, a champion
of Gwynharwyf
may attempt to smite
evil with one normal
melee attack. She adds her
Charisma bonus to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of
damage per champion of Gwynharwyf level. If she accidentally
smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect but the
ability is still used up for that day.
A 5th-level champion of Gwynharwyf can smite evil twice
per day. At 9th level, she can use this ability three times per day.
Divine Grace (Su): A 2nd-level champion of Gwynharwyf
gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus on all saving throws.
Furious Casting (Ex): Starting
at 2nd level, a champion of Gwynharwyf
can cast her champion spells
even while raging. If she has another
spellcasting class, she cannot cast spells
from that class while raging, only the spells
that she gains from her champion levels.
Damage Reduction (Ex): Starting
at 3rd level, a champion of Gwynharwyf
gains the ability to shrug off some amount
of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 2
from the damage the champion takes each time
she is dealt damage from a weapon or natural
attack. At 6th level, and every 2 levels thereafter,
this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage
reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.
Resist Enchantment (Su): At 3rd level, a champion of
Gwynharwyf gains a +2 morale bonus on all saving
throws against Enchantment spells or effects.
Fearsome Fury (Su): At 4th level, a champion of
Gwynharwyf can strike terror into the hearts of her
foes while she rages. When she enters a rage, she
makes an Intimidate check. Any enemy that comes
within 30 feet of her while she is raging must make a Will
save against a DC equal to her Intimidate check result. Those
who fail become shaken for 1d4+1 rounds or the duration of
the rage, whichever is longer.
Energy Resistance (Su): At 5th level, a champion of
Gwynharwyf grows closer to her eladrin patrons, gaining
acid, cold, and electricity resistance 5. This resistance
increases to 10 at 10th level.
Immune to Charm and Compulsion
(Ex): A 7th-level champion of
Gwynharwyf is completely immune to charm and
compulsion spells.

###Block:
59
Weapon and Armor Proficiency:Defenders of Sealtiel gain
no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Defensive Stance (Ex): When he needs to, a defender of
Sealtiel can become a stalwart bastion of defense. In this defensive
stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and durability,
but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He
gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance
bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC.
The increase in Constitution increases the defender
of Sealtiel's hit points by 2 points per level, but these
hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance
when the Constitution score drops back 4 points.
These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary
hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a
defender cannot use skills or abilities that would
require him to shift his position, such as
Move Silently or Jump. A defensive
stance lasts for a number of rounds equal
to 3 + the character's (newly improved)
Constitution modifier. A defender may
end his defensive stance voluntarily
prior to this limit. At the end of the
defensive stance, the defender is
winded and takes a -2 penalty to
Strength for the duration of that
encounter. A defender can only
use his defensive stance a certain
number of times per day as determined
by his level. Using the defensive
stance takes no time itself, but a
defender can only do so during his
action. (A defender can't, for example,
use the stance when struck down by an
arrow in order to get the extra hit points
from the increased Constitution.)
Shield of Faith (Sp): A defender of
Sealtiel can use shield of faith, as the
spell, three times per day. His effective
caster level is his defender level.
Magic Circle (Su): A defender of
Sealtiel who is 2nd level or higher is constantly
surrounded by an effect that
duplicates the magic circle against evil spell
as cast by a cleric of his defender level.
Shield Other (Sp): A 2nd-level defender of Sealtiel
can use shield other, as the spell, once per day. His effective caster
level is his defender level.
Blood of the Martyr (Sp): A 4th-level defender of Sealtiel can
use blood of the martyr*, as the spell, once per day. His effective
caster level is his defender level.
Protective Aura (Sp): A 6th-level defender of Sealtiel can use
protective aura, as the spell, once per day. The effect overlaps
(does not stack with) his constant magic circle against evil. His
effective caster level is his defender level.
At 10th level, a defender can use this ability three times per
day.
Glory of the Martyr (Sp): An 8th-level defender of Sealtiel can
use glory of the martyr*, as the spell, once per day. His effective
caster level is his defender level.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Emissaries of Barachiel
gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells: An emissary of Barachiel has the ability to cast a small
number of divine spells. To cast an emissary of Barachiel spell,
the emissary must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the
spell's level, so an emissary with a Charisma of 10 or lower
cannot cast these spells. Emissary of Barachiel bonus spells are
based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have
a DC of 10 + spell level + the emissary's Charisma modifier.
When the emissary gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance,
1st-level spells for a 1st-level emissary of Barachiel), he gets only
the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma
score for that spell level. The emissary's spell list appears below.
An emissary of Barachiel casts spells just as a bard does, except
that his spells are divine and not arcane.
Calling (Su): An emissary of Barachiel's most fundamental
ability is the power to issue a celestial call, stirring the conscience
of those who hear it. An emissary can use this ability once per day
per class level, spending a full-round action to issue the call.
Humanoid creatures within 30 feet of the emissary are potentially
affected. The emissary makes a Diplomacy check, and the result is
the DC for affected creatures' Will saving throws. Creatures that
fail their saves suffer effects that depend on their alignment, as
follows:
Alignment Effect
Lawful good Inspired
Neutral good or chaotic good Blessed
Lawful neutral Enthralled
Neutral or chaotic neutral Enthralled,
disheartened
Any evil Stunned, demoralized
Inspired: Affected creatures receive a +2 morale bonus on
attack rolls, saving throws, skill and ability checks, and weapon
damage rolls for 10 minutes.
Blessed: Affected creatures receive a +1 morale bonus on attack
rolls and on saving throws against fear effects for 10 minutes.
Enthralled: Affected creatures act as if subject to an enthrall
spell for as long as you continue to speak and for 1d3 rounds
thereafter. For the duration of the effect and for 1 day afterward,
affected creatures take a -1 penalty on Will saves related to
redemption (see Chapter 2).
Disheartened: Affected creatures take a -1 penalty on attack
rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 10
minutes.
Stunned: Affected creatures are stunned for 1 round.
Demoralized: Affected creatures take a -2 penalty on attack
rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and weapon
damage rolls for 10 minutes (including the 1 round during
which they are stunned).
Using any manifestation of the calling class ability requires
the use of the Words of Creation and deals 3d4 points of nonlethal
damage to the emissary. Calling is an Enchantment
(Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting] effect.
Conversion (Su): A 3rd-level emissary of Barachiel can use
his calling ability to facilitate actual conversion of nongood
humanoids. Doing so counts as a use of the calling class ability
(see above) for the day, and the initial effects of the calling are the
same-except that the emissary takes 5d4 points of nonlethal
damage instead of 3d4. When the initial effects are over, however,
all creatures that were subject to any effect of the calling
(except lawful good creatures) must make another saving throw.
Creatures who fail begin acting as though their alignment were
one step closer to good. Lawful evil creatures act lawful neutral,
neutral evil creatures act neutral, and chaotic evil creatures act
chaotic neutral. Lawful neutral and neutral good creatures act
lawful good. True neutral and chaotic good creatures act neutral
good, and chaotic neutral creatures act chaotic good.
Creatures affected by this temporary alignment shift can
make new saving throws each day for a total of seven days. If the
emissary is not present at the time a creature makes its save, it
receives a +1 circumstance bonus on the saving throw, and this
bonus increases by 1 for each additional saving throw for which
the emissary is not present.
During these seven days, an affected creature is immune to
any other conversion effect, from the same emissary or a different
one. During this time, the alignment shift can be reversed
with a break enchantment spell, but the caster must succeed on a
caster level check against a DC equal to the emissary's original
Diplomacy check result. Also during this time, an atonement
spell can make the alignment shift permanent, preventing the
creature from making any additional saving throws.
If a creature fails seven saving throws after the initial saving
throw against the calling, the alignment change is permanent.
At this point, the creature can change alignment again, either
through another conversion effect, or voluntarily (in a gradual
manner, as alignment change normally works-the creature
cannot simply decide to be evil again).

61

Sustenance (Su): At 5th level, an emissary of Barachiel can
help to keep good creatures good. As a use of his calling ability,
he can produce one of the following effects:
. Duplicate the effects of an atonement spell.
. Reverse any magical alignment change (such as that
produced by a helm of opposite alignment or a morality
undone spell).
. Dispel a charm or compulsion effect cast by an
evil creature upon a good target, by making a
dispel check (1d20 + character
level against a DC of 11 + evil
caster's level).
These effects require the emissary
of Barachiel to touch the
target creature.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Exalted arcanists gain no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Exalted Spell List: An exalted arcanist gains access to spells
that do not normally appear on arcane spellcasters' spell lists.
The exalted arcanist's spell list additions appear below. At 1st
level, an exalted arcanist adds the spells of up to 3rd level to her
spell list, and each additional exalted arcanist level grants her
access to two more spell levels on the spell list. She does not
automatically know these spells, but can choose them as spells
known.

62

Spell Knowledge (Ex): At 1st level, an exalted arcanist learns
two new arcane spells of any level up to the maximum spell
level she can cast. These can be spells from her normal spell list
or from the exalted spell list that appears below. She does not
gain any extra spell slots at this level.
Faster Consecrate (Ex): At 2nd level, an exalted arcanist can
spontaneously cast spells with the Consecrate Spell feat without
extending the spells' casting time.
Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each exalted arcanist level
after the first, the character gains new spells per day and spells
known as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting
class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class
level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character
of that class would have gained (bardic music abilities,
improved familiar abilities, and so on), though she does retain
the ability to exchange spells known with every even-numbered
equivalent sorcerer or bard level. If the character had more than
one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an exalted arcanist,
she must decide to which class she adds each exalted arcanist
level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells
known.
Bonus Exalted Feat: At 3rd level, and again at 5th level, an
exalted arcanist gains a bonus feat. This feat must be chosen
from the exalted feats that appear in Chapter 4.
Faster Purify (Ex): At 4th level, an exalted arcanist can spontaneously
cast spells with the Purify Spell feat without extending
the spells' casting time.
Sanctified Spells: A 5th-level exalted arcanist can use sanctified
spells as though they were among her spells known.

CLASS FEATURES
All of the following are class features of the fist of Raziel prestige
class.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A fist of Raziel is proficient
with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor,
and shields (except tower shields).
Magic Circle (Su): A 1st-level fist of Raziel is constantly surrounded
by a magic circle against evil effect, as the spell cast by
a cleric of the fist's character level.
Smite Evil (Su):Once per day, a fist of Raziel may attempt to
smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma
bonus to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per
class level. If she accidentally smites a creature that is not evil,
the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. She can
use this ability more times per day as she advances in level, as
shown on Table 5-10.

63

If the fist of Raziel has paladin levels as well, add the daily
uses from her fist of Raziel levels to the daily uses from her paladin
levels. Her damage bonus equals her fist of Raziel class
level plus her paladin class level. This ability does not stack
with the smite ability granted by the Destruction domain.
In addition to the basic function of smiting evil, a fist
of Raziel gains special abilities that operate whenever
she smites.
Good-Aligned: At 1st level, whenever a fist of Raziel
smites evil, her weapon is considered good-aligned for
purposes of overcoming damage reduction, as if she
had the Exalted Smite feat.
Confirming: At 3rd level, whenever a fist
of Raziel smites evil, all critical rolls are
automatically successful (so
every threat is a critical hit). This
works even if the weapon has a magical
effect related to critical hits, unlike the
similar effect of the bless weapon spell.
Holy: At 5th level, whenever a fist of
Raziel smites evil, her weapon is considered
holy, dealing an extra 2d6
points of damage against evil creatures.
This additional damage stacks with the
extra damage she deals from the smite.
However, it does not stack with the benefit
of the Sanctify Martial Strike feat or
with the extra damage dealt by a weapon
with the holy weapon property.
Fiendsmite: At 7th level, whenever a fist
of Raziel smites evil, her weapon deals an
extra 2d8 points of damage against evil outsiders
and evil undead, instead of the +2d6
normally dealt by a holy weapon. If
she also has the Exalted Smite
feat, this damage is still doubled.
Chain: At 9th level, whenever a
fist of Raziel smites evil, bolts of
holy power erupt from the target creature
and strike up to 5 additional evil targets
within 30 feet, chosen by the fist of Raziel. Targets take 2d6
points of damage, or 2d8 if they are evil outsiders or evil undead.
A successful Reflex save (DC 15 + the fist of Raziel's Cha modifier)
reduces the damage by half.
Spells per Day: Starting at 2nd level, and at each level thereafter,
a fist of Raziel gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a
level in a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before
adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any
other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved
chance of turning or destroying undead, improved special
mount, and so on). If the character had more than one
divine spellcasting class before becoming a fist of Raziel,
she must decide to which class she adds each fist of
Raziel level for the purpose of determining spells per day.
Sanctify Martial Strike: At 4th level, a fist of
Raziel gains the Sanctify Martial Strike feat as a
bonus feat.

Sunder Evil Item (Su): At 6th level, whenever a fist of Raziel
attacks an object that is evil (such as an unholy sword or a darkskull)
or an evil construct (such as a retriever), she deals double damage.
This does not stack with the benefits of the Great Sunder feat.
Holy Martial Strike (Su): Any weapon that a 10th-level fist of
Raziel wields is treated as a holy weapon, dealing an extra 2d6
points of damage to evil creatures, even when she is not smiting
evil. This additional damage does not stack with the benefit of the
Sanctify Martial Strike feat or with the extra damage dealt by a
weapon with the holy weapon property.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Initiates of
Pistis Sophia gain no proficiency
with any weapon or armor. They
suffer the same penalties for
wearing armor that
monks do.
Fist of the Heavens:
A 1st-level initiate
of Pistis Sophia
gains the Fist of the Heavens
feat as a bonus feat, even if she does not have
the prerequisite Wisdom score.
Monk Abilities: An initiate of Pistis Sophia
adds her initiate levels to her monk levels to
determine her AC bonus, her unarmed
strike damage, the penalty she takes
when using a flurry of blows, her
speed, and her ki strike. She does
not gain any other benefits of
advancing monk levels, however.
Detect Evil (Sp): At will, an initiate
of Pistis Sophia of 2nd level or
higher can use detect evil, as the spell.
Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, an initiate of Pistis
Sophia may attempt to smite evil with one normal
unarmed strike. She adds a +4 bonus to her attack
roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class
level. If she accidentally smites a creature that
is not evil, the smite has no effect but it is still
used up for that day.

65
At 5th level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia can use this ability
twice per day, and at 8th level she can use it three times per day.
Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 3rd level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia
can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to
do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flatfooted.
Electricity Resistance (Ex): As she advances in her celestial
disciplines, an initiate of Pistis Sophia grows to share the natural
immunity to electricity possessed by the archons. She gains
electricity resistance 5 at 4th level, and electricity resistance 10
at 7th level.
Sacred Vow: At 4th level, and again at 7th level and 10th
level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia gains a bonus feat selected from
the following list:
Vow of Abstinence, Vow of Chastity, Vow of Nonviolence,
Vow of Obedience, Vow of Poverty, or Vow of Purity.
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 6th level, an initiate of
Pistis Sophia cannot be flanked except by a rogue at least 4 levels
higher than her character level.
Improved Evasion (Ex): At 9th level, an initiate of Pistis
Sophia takes no damage on a successful saving throw against
attacks that allow a Reflex save for half damage, and she only
takes half damage on a failed save.
Improved Evasion (Ex): When subjected to an attack that
normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a 9th
level initiate of Pistis Sophia takes no damage if she makes a
successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw
fails.
Celestial Transformation (Ex): When she reaches 10th
level, an initiate of Pistis Sophia transcends her mortal origins
and becomes a creature of the heavens. Her type changes to outsider
(native), and she gains damage reduction 10/unholy.

66
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Lions of Talisid gain no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Animal Companion (Ex): A lion of Talisid can add his lion
of Talisid levels to his effective druid level (his actual druid level
or one-half his ranger level) to determine the capabilities of his
animal companion.
Lion's Courage (Ex): A lion of Talisid is immune to fear
(magical or otherwise) and gains a +4 sacred bonus on Will saves
against other mind-affecting spells and effects.
Spells per Day: At each level, a lion of Talisid gains new
spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting
class to which he belonged before adding the prestige
class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character
of that class would have gained. If the character had more
than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a lion of Talisid,
the player must decide to which class to add each lion of
Talisid level for the purpose of determining spells per day.
Scent (Ex): At 2nd level, a lion of Talisid gains the scent special
quality. He can detect approaching enemies, sniff out
hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
Wild Shape (Su): At 3rd level, a lion of Talisid gains the ability
to turn himself into any Small or Medium animal and back
again once per day. This works exactly as the druid's wild shape
ability. Lions of Talisid prefer the shape of great cats (cheetahs or
leopards at lower levels), but are not limited to such forms.
The lion of Talisid can use this ability more times per day at
4th, 5th, and 8th level, as noted on Table 5-12. In addition, he
gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 6th level,
and a Tiny animal at 9th level.
A lion of Talisid who is also a druid can add his lionof Talisid
level -2 to his druid levels to determine his wild shape ability.
For example, an 8th-level druid/6th-level lion of Talisid can wild
shape as a 12th-level druid, and can thus assume plant forms as
well as Large and Tiny animal forms, and can use this ability 4
times per day.
Exalted Companion: At 4th level, a lion of Talisid gains the
Exalted Companion feat as a bonus feat.
Lion's Pounce (Ex): At 5th level, a lion of Talisid can make a
full attack at the end of a charge.
Lion's Swiftness (Ex):When he reaches 7th level, a lion of Talisid
can act as if under the effects of a haste spell for a total of 1
round per class level per day. These rounds need not be consecutive.
Leonal's Roar (Su): Three times a day, a 10th-level lion of Talisid
can issue a roar that duplicates the effects of the leonal's roar
spell (new spell described in Chapter 6 of this book). The saving
throw DC is 20 + the lion of Talisid's Charisma modifier.

67
Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
Prophets of Erathaol gain no proficiency
with any weapon or armor.
Ecstasy (Su): Once per day per class
level, a prophet of Erathaol can enter an
ecstatic state, allowing a celestial to seize
control of her mind
and speech. This is
sort of a lesser version
of channeling
celestials (as
described in Chapter
2), in which the
prophet simply becomes
helpless for 1
round while a celestial
speaks through her. What
the celestial says (and who
it is) is entirely up to the DM,
though it is always at least tangentially
relevant to whatever matter is
at hand. As a rule of thumb, this ability
can have one of the following effects:
. any Knowledge check (with a bonus
equal to the prophet's character
level +5)
. a bardic knowledge check
(with a bonus equal to the
prophet's character level +5)
. a divination spell
. a detect evil spell
. an enthrall spell (the prophet can continue speaking on her
own after the 1 round of ecstasy, continuing the effect)
. a good hope spell
. an atonement spell
. like a phylactery of faithfulness, allowing the prophet to identify
evil creatures and avoid evil acts
. if the prophet sacrifices 500 XP, a commune spell
Unfortunately, at the instant a prophet of Erathaol cedes control
of her mind and invites a celestial to take it, she is vulnerable
to possession by less beneficent spirits. If a fiend or ghost
capable of possession is
in ethereal form, within
30 feet of the prophet,
and not flat-footed when
a prophet enters her
ecstasy, the creature can attempt
to possess her immediately.
The prophet takes a -2
penalty on her Will save to resist
the possession, and if she fails she
is not aware of the creature's presence
in her body. The creature prevents
a celestial from entering, and
might pretend to be the celestial, speaking as
the prophet's companions expect. If the creature
chooses not to make its presence known in this
way, it seems as though the ecstasy simply fails.
Spells per Day/Spells Known: At 2nd
level, and at each level thereafter, a prophet
of Erathaol gains new spells per day (and
spells known, if applicable) as if she had
also gained a level in a spellcasting class
she belonged to before adding the prestige
class. She does not, however, gain
any other benefit a character of that class
would have gained (improved chance of
turning or destroying undead, metamagic
or item creation feats, and so on),
except for an increased effective level of
spellcasting. If a character had more
than one spellcasting class before
becoming a prophet of Erathaol, she
must decide to which class she
adds each prophet level for
the purpose of determining
spells per day.

68
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Risen
martyrs gain no proficiency with any weapon
or armor.
Spiritual Body (Ex): When a martyr rises as
a 0-level risen martyr, he takes on a corporeal
spirit form. His creature type changes to deathless
(see Chapter 8: Monsters), and he gains
the features and traits of the deathless type.
Deathless creatures have no Constitution
score, and the risen martyr rerolls his hit
points using d12s instead of his previous
racial and class-based Hit Dice.
A risen martyr's spiritual body is formed
of solid, spiritual flesh and is neither
ghostly nor incorporeal. His ability
scores remain unchanged (except for
his Constitution score), and all
his other characteristics
remain the same
except that he is no longer
a living creature.
Charisma Score Increase:
At 1st level, a


69
risen martyr's Charisma score increases by +2. At 5th level, it
increases by an extra +2.
Deflection Bonus (Su): A 1st-level risen martyr gains a
deflection bonus to Armor Class equal to his Charisma bonus.
Holy Purpose (Ex): A 1st-level risen martyr receives a +1
sacred bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, and
skill checks that are directly related to the fulfillment of his purpose.
This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level, and increases by an
extra +1 every 3 levels thereafter.
Bless (Sp): Three times per day, a risen martyr of at least 2nd
level can use bless, as the spell.
Magic Circle Against Evil (Su): At 2nd level, a risen martyr
is continually surrounded by a protective aura that functions as
a magic circle against evil spell.
Daylight (Su): At will as a free action, a 3rd level
risen martyr can use daylight, as the spell.
Acid Immunity (Ex): At 4th level, a
risen martyr gains immunity to acid.
Detect Evil (Sp): At will, a risen martyr of at
least 4th level can detect evil, as the spell.
Protective Aura (Su): At 5th
level, the risen martyr's magic circle
against evil is replaced by an effect
that duplicates the protective aura
spell.
Shield Other (Sp): A 6th-level
risen martyr can use shield other, as the
spell, three times per day.
Celestial Brilliance (Sp): A 7th-level
risen martyr can use celestial brilliance,
as the spell, once per
day.
Cold Immunity (Ex): A 7thlevel
risen martyr gains immunity
to cold.
Holy Aura (Su): At 8th level, the risen
martyr's protective aura is supplemented
by an effect that duplicates the holy aura
spell. The holy aura protects only the
risen martyr, while his protective aura
continues to protect allies within 10
feet as well as himself.
Electricity Immunity
(Ex): At 9th level, a risen
martyr gains immunity to
electricity.
Perfection (Su): A 10thlevel
risen martyr is as close to
celestial perfection as a mortal creature can be.
He is considered a celestial for the purpose of any spell or effect
that has special effects on celestials. If he is lawful, he is also
considered an archon. If he is chaotic, he is also considered an
eladrin. If he is neutral, he is also considered a guardinal. If he is
a spellcaster, he can cast spells that have the Celestial, Archon,
Guardinal, or Eladrin components, as appropriate.
Final Ascension:When a 10th-level risen martyr has earned
enough experience points to gain his next level, his perfected,
spiritual body is taken whole into the upper planes.
A risen martyr cannot advance in any class other than risen
martyr in order to delay his final ascension. Once he rises and
adopts this prestige class, he must continue to gain risen martyr
levels and no levels in any other class.
Code of Conduct: A risen martyr who willfully performs an
evil act is immediately destroyed and goes to face his judgment
on the Upper Planes.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Sentinels of Bharrai gain
no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each level, a sentinel of
Bharrai gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable)
as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she
belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however,
gain any other benefit a character of that class would have
gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead,
metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an
increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character had
more than one spellcasting class before becoming a sentinel of
Bharrai, she must decide to which class she adds each sentinel
level for the purpose of determining spells per day.
Nature-Friendly Spells (Su): Starting at 1st level, a sentinel
of Bharrai can change the composition of any energy-based
spell he casts to something that is not destructive to nature. The
spell must have the acid, cold, electricity, or fire subtype, and the
sentinel of Bharrai may choose to deal nonlethal damage
instead of lethal damage against animals and plants that are
either targeted or otherwise affected by the spell.
Track: A 1st-level sentinel of Bharrai gains the Track feat as a
bonus feat.
Energy Resistance 10 (Ex): A sentinel of Bharrai is resistant
to certain forces of nature and the damage they wreak. At 2nd
level, and again at 4th level, 6th level, and 8th level, a sentinel of
Bharrai chooses a specific type of energy-acid, cold, electricity,
or fire-and gains resistance 10 against the selected energy
type.
Bear Shape (Su): At 3rd level, the sentinel of Bharrai gains
the ability to turn himself into a black bear, brown bear, or polar
bear (and back again). The selected bear form's Hit Dice cannot
exceed the sentinel of Bharrai's character level.
This ability functions as the polymorph spell, except as noted
here. Changing form is a standard action and doesn't provoke
attacks of opportunity. The sentinel of Bharrai may assume bear
form (and change back) at will and may remain in bear form as
long as he wishes.
The sentinel of Bharrai retains the ability to speak while in
bear form and may communicate with other bears.
Quickened Call Lightning (Sp): At 3rd level, a sentinel of Bharrai
can cast a quickened call lightning spell once per day, as
though using the Quicken Spell feat. Use the sentinel of Bharrai's
character level to determine the number of lightning bolts
and the spell's duration.
Nature's Veil (Su): At 5th level, as a standard action, the sentinel
of Bharrai can attempt to hide in the outdoors. The sentinel
of Bharrai must be standing within 10 feet of natural terrain that
includes features such as trees, sand dunes, mounds of snow,
large rocks, tall grasses, or thickets. The sentinel of Bharrai gains
a +10 insight bonus on his Hide check under these circumstances.
Dire Bear Shape (Su): At 7th level, a sentinel of Bharrai can
turn himself into a dire bear and back again. This ability is otherwise
the same as the bear form ability gained at 3rd level.
Ursinal's Touch (Su): A sentinel of Bharrai gains great healing
powers at 7th level. This ability works just like the paladin's
lay on hands ability, except that the sentinel of Bharrai can heal
as much damage per day as his own undamaged hit point total.
Cavalry of Dire Bears (Sp): Once per week beginning at 9th
level, a sentinel of Bharrai may call 1d6 dire bears with maximum
hit points (147 hp each) to aid him in battle. The dire bears
appear instantly and remain until the battle has ended, at which
point they disperse into the wild. If a dire bear falls in battle, the
animal's corpse remains, and the sentinel of Bharrai is expected
to use whatever parts of the animal he can (such as the meat,
skin, and bones) and commit the rest to the earth. Failing to
properly honor a fallen dire bear results in a 20% cumulative
chance that the animals do not come the next time they are
called.
This ability works only on the Material Plane and on goodaligned
outer planes.
Quickened Lightning Storm (Sp): At 10th level, a sentinel of
Bharrai can cast a quickened lightning stormspell once per day, as
though using the Quicken Spell feat. Use the sentinel of Bharrai's
character level to determine the number of lightning bolts
and the spell's duration.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
A skylord is proficient
with all simple and martial
weapons, all types of armor, and
shields.
Spells per Day/Spells Known:
At every second level, a skylord gains
new spells per day (and spells known, if
applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting
class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He
does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that
class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or
rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points
beyond those he receives from the prestige class, and so on),
except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character
had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a
skylord, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for
purposes of determining spells per day.
Call Flying Mount (Su): At 1st level as a full-round action,
the skylord can call a flying mount to serve in his crusade
against evil. This mount can be a celestial giant eagle, celestial

73
giant owl, or celestial pegasus (consult the Skylord's Mounts
sidebar for details). The mount remains with the skylord until it
is slain or dismissed. It requires food and rest, and the skylord is
responsible for tending to its needs.
Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect. If the mount
dies, the skylord can either have the mount raised from the dead
or call another mount. The skylord may only call a replacement
mount after living and meditating atop a mountain for 1 week.
Eyes of the Eagle (Ex): A skylord has the keen eyesight of an
eagle. While airborne, a skylord receives a +4 insight bonus on
Spot checks.
Ride the Wind (Ex): At 2nd level, a skylord becomes
a master of the winds, guiding his mount through
them with ease. While riding a flying mount, the skylord's
penalties on ranged attacks in windy conditions
are reduced by 2 (no penalty in strong
winds, -2 penalty in severe winds). The skylord
can make ranged attacks in windstorms,
albeit at a -4 penalty. In hurricanes, the
ranged attack penalty increases to -8. Neither
the skylord nor his mount take penalties
on Listen checks in windstorms and
hurricanes.
Both the skylord and his mount can move
normally in severe winds and windstorms
(instead of being checked), and hurricane
winds reduce the flying speed of the skylord's
mount by half.
Improved Mounted Combat (Ex):
At 3rd level, a skylord's skill at mounted
combat improves, enabling him to
better protect his mount. This ability
works as the Mounted Combat feat,
except that the skylord's Ride check
receives a +2 bonus. The bonus
improves to +4 at 5th level, +6 at 7th
level, and +8 at 9th level.
Deadly Charge (Ex): At 4th
level, a skylord deals an extra 2d6
points of damage on a successful
attack made during a charge. The skylord
must be riding a
flying mount to deal the
extra damage.
Storm Kinship (Su): At 6th level, a skylord is less likely to
lose his bearings in a storm. He retains full visibility during rains
and storms and does not take the usual penalties on Search, Spot,
and Listen checks (see Weather in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
This ability is not imparted to the skylord's mount.
Summon Tempest (Sp): At 10th level, once per week, the skylord
can summon a tempest (as described on page 193 of the
Monster Manual II). This ability is otherwise similar to the
summon monster I spell. Use the skylord's character level to
determine the effect's range and duration.

###Block: Skylord Mount
72
Empathic Link (Su): A skylord has an empathic link with his
mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The skylord cannot see
through the mount's eyes, but they can communicate empathically.
Because of this empathic link, the skylord has the same
connection to an item or place that his mount does, just as
with a master and his familiar (see Familiars in the Player's
Handbook).
Share Spells: At the skylord's option, he may have any spell
(but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his
mount. The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting
to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other
than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves
farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again
even if it returns to the skylord before the duration expires.
Additionally, the skylord may cast a spell with a target of "You"
on his mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. A
skylord and his mount can share spells even if the spells
normally do not affect magical beasts.
Improved Natural Attacks: The damage dealt by each of the
mount's natural attacks increases by one step. For example, a
giant eagle mount with this ability would roll 1d8 instead of
1d6 for claw damage and 1d10 instead of 1d8 for bite damage.
Improved Fly Speed (Ex): The mount's fly speed increases by
10 feet.
Deadly Charge (Ex): The skylord's mount deals an extra 2d6
points of damage on a successful attack made during a charge.
Spell Resistance (Su): A mount's spell resistance equals the
skylord's character level + 5.
Immunities (Su): A skylord's mount is immune to hold, paralysis,
sleep, charms, and compulsions.
Bonus Feat: The mount gains one of the following feats as a
bonus feat, provided it meets the prerequisites for the feat:
Flyby Attack, Hover, Multiattack, or Wingover.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Slayers of Domiel gain no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells: A slayer of Domiel has the
ability to cast a small number of
divine spells. To cast a slayer of
Domiel spell, the slayer
must have a Wisdom
score of at least 10 +
the spell's level, so a
slayer of Domiel
with a Wisdom of
10 or lower cannot
cast these
spells. Slayer of
Domiel bonus
spells are based
on Wisdom, and
saving throws
against these
spells have a DC
of 10 + spell level
+ the slayer's
Wisdom modifier.
When the slayer of
Domiel gets 0 spells
of a given spell level
(for instance, 1st-level
spells for a 1st level
slayer of Domiel), she
gets only the bonus spells
she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that
spell level.
The slayer of Domiel's spell list appears below. A slayer of
Domiel prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a
slayer cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).
Death Touch (Su): A slayer of Domiel can slay living evil
opponents with a single touch. She must succeed on a melee
touch attack against the target. When she touches, she rolls 1d6
per slayer level. If the total at least equals the target's current hit
points, it dies. This is a death effect, and it has no effect on nonevil
creatures.
A slayer of Domiel can use this ability more often as she
increases in levels, as shown on Table 5-17.
Detect Evil (Sp): At will, as the spell of the same name.
Sneak Attack (Ex): If a slayer of Domiel can catch an opponent
when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her
attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time a
slayer's target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC
(whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the
slayer's attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage at 1st level
and an additional 1d6 at every two slayer levels thereafter (3rd,
5th, 7th, and 9th). Should a slayer of Domiel score a critical hit
with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.
It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so
ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is
within 30 feet.
With a sap or an unarmed strike, a slayer of Domiel can make
a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal
damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to

75
deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual
-4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in
order to execute the sneak attack.
A slayer of Domiel can only sneak attack living creatures with
discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and
incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that
is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The
slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a
vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer of
Domiel cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment
or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are
beyond reach.
If a slayer of Domiel gets a sneak attack bonus from another
source (such as rogue levels), the extra damage stacks.
Divine Grace (Su): A 2nd-level slayer of Domiel applies her
Charisma bonus as a bonus on all saving throws.
Improved Evasion (Ex): At 6th level, a slayer of Domiel's
evasion ability improves. When subjected to an attack that normally
allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the slayer
takes no damage if she makes a successful saving throw and half
damage if the saving throw fails.

Blind-Fight				TYPE:General.Fighter.AttackOption																																																																																		DESC:In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit (see Concealment, page 152). An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible (see Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151). The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however. You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces your speed to three-quarters normal, instead of one-half (see Table 9-4: Hampered Movement, page 163). Normal: Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you (see Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers, page 151) apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility (see Table 9-4: Hampered Movement, page 163) also applies. Special: The Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink spell (see page 206). A fighter may select Blind-Fight as one of his fighter bonus feats (see page 38).

Brew Potion				TYPE:ItemCreation.Wizard						PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=3,SPELLCASTER.Divine=3																																																						DEFINE:BrewLevel|3												DESC:You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level ? its caster level ? 50 gp. to brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price. When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell. Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Cleave				TYPE:General.Fighter.AttackOption															PREFEAT:1,Power Attack																																							PRESTAT:1,STR=13								DEFINE:CleaveCount|0												DESC:If you deal a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points or killing it), you get an immediate, extra melee attack against another creature within reach. You cannot take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same bonus as the attack that dropped the previous creature. You can use this ability once per round. Special: A fighter may select Cleave as one of his fighter bonus feats (see page 38).

Combat Reflexes			TYPE:General.Fighter.AttackOption																																																																																		DESC:When foes leave themselves open, you may make a number of additional attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus. For example, a fighter with a Dexterity of 15 can make a total of three attacks of opportunity in 1 round-the one attack of opportunity any character is entitled to, plus two more because of his +2 Dexterity bonus. If four goblins move out of the character's threatened squares, he can make one attack of opportunity each against three of the four. You can still make only one attack of opportunity per opportunity. With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed. Normal: A character without this feat can make only one attack of opportunity per round and can't make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed. Special: The Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability (see page 51) more than once per round.

The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost. You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make.

Crafting a wand takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a wand is its caster level ? the spell level ? 750 gp. to craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price. A newly created wand has 50 charges. Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the cost derived from the base price, you must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.92
Craft Wondrous Item		TYPE:ItemCreation.Wizard						PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=3,SPELLCASTER.Divine=3																																																																					DESC:You can create any wondrous item whose prerequisites you meet (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for prerequisites and other information on wondrous items). Enchanting a wondrous item takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its price. to enchant a wondrous item, you must spend 1/25 of the item's price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this price.

Once per round when you would normally be hit with a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants, and ranged attacks generated by spell effects, such as Melf's acid arrow, can't be deflected. Special: A monk may select Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat at 2nd level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

When using this feat, you can take either a single move or standard action each turn, but not both, and you cannot take a full-round action. You can take a move action without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other action the DM deems as strenuous, including some free actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. If you reach -10 hit points, you immediately die.

You can select a new opponent on any action. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
